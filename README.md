This is my latest version of my first game project on JavaScript using p5js library. This is a simple game with simple physics and mechanics. The goal of the game is to reach the finish by avoiding canyons and enemies. 

The main feature of the game is that you can custom your path yourself by changing the length of the path, adding enemies if you wish to or show the collision shapes of objects in the game.

To start the game:
1) Download the whole project
2) Open index.html in an editor and choose any browser you wish the game to create.
3) Play
